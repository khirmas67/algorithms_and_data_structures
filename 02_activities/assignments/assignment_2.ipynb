    "Daya's solution for finding missing numbers in a list of integers from 0 to n is a clear and efficient approach. By taking advange of using set properties, the initial solution computes the difference between the ideal range and the input list, and identifying missing numbers in a diresct way. However, the space complexity of O(n) and the sorting step's O(n log n) time complexity limit its efficiency for larger datasets.\n",

    " Daya proposes uses an alternative approch to address these limotationsThis approach takes an advantage of in-place marking. By negating values at indices corresponding to the numbers in the list This approach reduces space complexity to O(1) and achieves a linear time complexity of O(n). This makes it suitable for large datasets..\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative solution that uses boolean array can also solve the problem in O(n) time, but with O(n) space complexity. While less space-efficient than in-place marking, it offers a more intuitive approach for some users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Daya's solution highlights the importance of considering both time and space complexity when choosing an algorithm. The in-place marking solution is generally preferred for large datasets due to its optimal space complexity, but the boolean array approach can be a simpler alternative in some cases. Understanding these trade-offs allows for selecting the most appropriate solution for a given problem and dataset size.\n"
